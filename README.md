# TATA-Data-Visualisation-

In this virtual experience program provided by Tata iQ or Tata Insights and Quants, participants are tasked with analyzing data for an online retail store and providing valuable insights to the CEO and CMO. The program consists of four modules: Framing the Business Scenario, Choosing the Right Visuals, Creating Effective Visuals, and Communicating Insights and Analysis.

Task 1 - Framing the Business Scenario:
Participants are required to draft important and relevant questions that the CEO and CMO would ask based on the provided dataset. The questions should cover both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the business, considering the perspectives of both leaders.

Task 2 - Choosing the Right Visuals:
Participants need to select the most effective visuals for various scenarios based on the requirements of the CEO and CMO. They must choose visuals that best represent the information and insights they want to convey. Resources on selecting visuals and charts based on different scenarios are provided.

Task 3 - Creating Effective Visuals:
Using either Tableau or Power BI, participants create visuals for four specific questions requested by the CEO and CMO. They must clean the data by removing bad data entries and create separate visuals on different tabs. The visuals should address the requirements of the executives and assist in decision-making and expansion strategies.

Task 4 - Communicating Insights and Analysis:
Participants develop a script and record a video presenting their findings to the CEO and CMO based on the previous tasks. They explain their thought process, data cleanup, and analysis. The focus should be on providing clear and straightforward explanations of the insights gained from the visuals and how they relate to the executives' questions and the overall business strategy.

By completing these tasks, participants gain hands-on experience in analyzing data, selecting appropriate visuals, and effectively communicating insights to top-level executives, thereby honing their skills in data visualization and business analytics.
